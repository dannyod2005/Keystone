// #346 — company/product "About us" page. Same shape as PrivacyScreen
// (#345): publicly accessible (no RequireAuth on its route in App.jsx),
// since this is the kind of page someone reads before signing up, not
// after. Content below reuses the product's existing marketing voice
// (see HomeScreen's logged-out hero copy) rather than inventing a new
// tone — placeholder-appropriate for a prototype/demo, swap in real
// copy once there's a finalized company description to use.

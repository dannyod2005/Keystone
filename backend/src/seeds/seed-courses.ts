//
// #109 — expanded from the original 6-course prototype set to ~40 courses
// spread across the three catalogue categories, so filtering/browsing
// feels realistic for a demo. Scope decisions, spelled out since they
// shape what #100 still needs to do:
//   - Every module gets a real, verified-embeddable YouTube video URL
//     (see VIDEO POOLS below) — video playback is one of the "core UX"
//     pillars #109 explicitly gates on, so every module needed a working
//     player, not just a placeholder icon. Topic accuracy wasn't required
//     (per the issue), so these are a curated pool of long-standing public
//     talks/tutorials reused across modules, loosely matched by category
//     (tutorial content for Technical, talks for Business/Leadership).
//   - Only the FIRST module of every course gets a quiz here (2 questions
//     each) — enough to satisfy "most/all courses have quiz questions" at
//     the course level and prove the feature works across the whole
//     catalogue, but NOT full per-module coverage. Populating every
//     remaining module's quiz is deliberately left to #100, which was
//     scoped as the dedicated follow-up for exactly that.
//   - FAQs moved from one generic PLACEHOLDER pair (shared by literally
//     every course) to three category-specific pairs, reused within each
//     category. Still reused rather than fully unique per course — real,
//     non-generic copy, just not bespoke per course, which felt like the
//     right effort/benefit line for 40 courses.
